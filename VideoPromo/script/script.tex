Nhat is working in potentially hazardous environment. He is either soldering or fixing his bike inside the closed Lab. 
\\-\\
He feels something wrong but ignores it and continue his works.
\\-\\
He chokes, furiously screams, then faints throughout the second scene.

\intslug[Rewind first scene, camera follows the MC]{Laboratory 2 - 40s}

The MC points 1 finger up and explains the CO2/air poisoning and how hazardous our working/living environment can becomes. He introduces the AQI Tracker as well.

\begin{dialogue}{The MC}
Do you knows what causes suffocation to this gentlemen here?
\end{dialogue}
-\\
Camera panning from Nhat lying near the hazard source to the closed door.
\\-\\
\begin{dialogue}{The MC}
Closed environment with gradually accumulated hazardous content in the air, carbon dioxide, small particles included.
\end{dialogue}
-\\
Camera back to the MC.
\\-\\
\begin{dialogue}{The MC}
But how come he didn't even realize at all? Indeed he does but since the pollutants accumulate in small portions, he wouldn't consider this a threat, till the air was so polluted his body couldn't endure and it was too late then.
\end{dialogue}

The MC introducing AQI Tracker.
\\-\\ 
\begin{dialogue}{The MC}
You know what, this could have been prevented, if we had this miraculous device, the AQI Tracker. Just take a look at this.
\end{dialogue}
The MC points at the device and change his focus to previously-fainted-but-now-gets-up Nhat

\intslug[Camera pans to Nhat working]{Laboratory 3 - 25s}
Nhat concentrates in his work until the small device near him buzzes.
He looks at the screen now to see that the AQI gets bad.
\begin{dialogue}{nhat}
Oh the AQI is bad, I should open the door and go outside for a while.
\end{dialogue}

Nhat then proceeds to open the door and inhales fresh air with a satisfied face.-\_-

\intslug[Camera focuses on Nhat and the MC]{Outside 1 - 80s}
The MC walk outside with the device on his hand. Both Nhat and The MC take turn in introducing the AQI Tracker.

\begin{dialogue}{The MC}
As part of solution to Global Air Pollution problem, team ABC is pleased to introduce the AQI Tracker, which measures air pollutants with little error and present to you on a compact, informative screen. Here Ã­ a closer look. 
\end{dialogue}
-\\
Camera zoom in the device and Nhat explain what's on it. Nhat also sit down near the device so camera can catch his face.
\\-\\
\begin{dialogue}{nhat}
As you can see, the device can measure CO2 concentration, HCHO concentration as well as fine particles PM 2.5 and PM 1.0. All in one device on my hand.
